# A Puff's Desire ~

---

### 1. High Concept

 Remember Chuzzle Deluxe? The cute little puffs would yawn, get angry, sneeze, and explode into balls of fur all over your screen! It's almost like they had personalities and lives all of their own. 

*_What if I told you that they do have lives and personalities all their own, with a certain insatiable craving..._*

### 2. Genre

This game is a colorful and casual "bullet-hell" style survival game.

---

### 3. Platform

The game can be played on either a computer or a mobile/touchscreen device. 

---

### 4. Story

The game follows the life of the Puff from when it wakes up in the morning, to when it goes to sleep at night. 

But... just what does the Puff do?
The puff uses its impeccable reaction speed to dodge healthy foods and eat all of the sweets! The puff absolutely craves sweets and has a giant sweet tooth. It is never satisfied!

The player motivation will be to challenge themselves to survive for the longest amount of time possible within the colorful food chaos.

### 5. Esthetics

The game with be a very cute, happy, and colorful game, with a cute-cartoonish style to it. The puff will look be based off of the Chuzzles in Chuzzle Deluxe. The food particle "enemies" will the all different healthy foods. Sweet, dessert type foods will act as powerups.

The game will have short animations of the puff doing different things when click on within the main screen as well as having "death" scenes.

The game's background sound during the actual gameplay will be an upbeat "techno" instrumental. See the videos below for a few references.

Other sounds will include ones that fit the puffs animations, such as sneezes, grrs, death explosions, etc.

### 6. Gameplay

###### Mechanics

The game of the game are simple. The player can choose between different colored/styled puffs and uses the controls to avoid the healthy foods on the screen as they multiply and become faster overtime. Powerups, such as one that slows down time around you, can be gained by colliding/touching them to pick them up. They are stored (only one can be held at a time) and can be used whenever the player wishes to do so.

###### Control

For computers: The game is played with only a keyboard. You use [w], [a], [s], [d] to move and for scrolling through menus and [spacebar] to activate power ups or for selecting within menus. 

For mobile/touchscreen: The game is played with touch gestures/slides/swipes for moving and scrolling through menus and tap the screen to select within menus or activate power ups.

###### Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"

Within the menu there are instructions on how to play the game and user controls. There is no in-game tutorial of any sort, however.

###### Player learning

To beat the game, the player will learn to truly hone their reaction and timing skills through practice dodging the healthy food "enemy" particles and more efficient usage of the dessert powerups. 

Although, sometimes, all it really takes is a bit of luck.

### 8. Other

To play the game, external libraries are not required to be used, though that is may be subject to change in the future. 

If possible I would like to figure out how to store data, however, so that I could have an achievements system, goals for the player to aim for such as using x amount of power ups, surviving x minutes, etc.
